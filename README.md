# Taiwanese Sign Language Recognization

## Dataset
The data use in this project is mainly from [TSL Dictionary](https://twtsl.ccu.edu.tw/TSL/#result) or recorded by ourselves. Since the data is still not enough for training, we also choose words that have similar sign language with TSL from [ASL Dictionary](https://www.handspeak.com/word/).

The folder `data` is the dataset used in the current implementation. 

For more data, please refer to this [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MKhI9XWJfgcfBFoQvLEDa8zNixrWy2VC?usp=sharing).
